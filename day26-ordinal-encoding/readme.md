#### **1. What is Ordinal Data? (03:06)**:
- **Ordinal data** is a type of categorical data where the values have a meaningful order or ranking, but the differences between the values are not measured. Examples include education level (`High School < Bachelor's < Master's < PhD`) or rating scales (`Poor < Fair < Good < Excellent`).
- In ordinal data, the order matters, but the intervals between categories are not necessarily consistent or meaningful.

#### **2. Label Encoding (05:27)**:
- **Label Encoding** converts categorical text values into numerical values. For ordinal data, it assigns unique integers to each category.
- For example, if you have categories like `Low`, `Medium`, and `High`, Label Encoding might assign `Low = 0`, `Medium = 1`, and `High = 2`. 
- This technique is used for both ordinal and nominal data, but for ordinal data, the assigned numbers respect the natural order.

#### **3. How Ordinal Encoding Works? (07:09)**:
- **Ordinal encoding** is a specific form of Label Encoding where the categories are encoded based on their order. 
- This works by converting the ranked categories into integers that represent the order of the data.
  - For example:
    - `Poor = 0`
    - `Fair = 1`
    - `Good = 2`
    - `Excellent = 3`
- The key aspect of ordinal encoding is that the values maintain a meaningful order, making it suitable for models where the ranking of features is important.

#### **4. Code Example (09:20)**:
Hereâ€™s a Python example using `pandas` and `sklearn` for ordinal encoding:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import OrdinalEncoder

# Example dataset with ordinal data
data = {'Rating': ['Poor', 'Fair', 'Good', 'Excellent']}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Define the order of categories
categories = [['Poor', 'Fair', 'Good', 'Excellent']]

# Create OrdinalEncoder with the predefined categories order
encoder = OrdinalEncoder(categories=categories)

# Fit and transform the data
df['Rating_encoded'] = encoder.fit_transform(df[['Rating']])

# Display the encoded values
print(df)
```

In this example, the `OrdinalEncoder` converts the `Rating` column into integers, respecting the order defined in `categories`.

Output:
```
      Rating  Rating_encoded
0       Poor             0.0
1       Fair             1.0
2       Good             2.0
3  Excellent             3.0
```
