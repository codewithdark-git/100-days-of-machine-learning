Feature scaling is a technique used in machine learning to normalize or standardize the range of independent variables or features of data. Here’s an overview based on your timeline:

### 02:16 - **Why do we need feature scaling?**
- Feature scaling is necessary because many machine learning algorithms, like gradient descent-based models (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression) and distance-based models (e.g., k-NN, SVM), perform better when the features have a consistent scale. If features vary widely in scale, the algorithm might give undue importance to features with a larger range, leading to biased results.
  
### 04:58 - **Types of feature scaling**
- **Normalization (Min-Max Scaling)**: Rescales the data so that all values lie within a specific range, often [0, 1].
- **Standardization (Z-score Normalization)**: The formula for z-score standardization is `z = (x - μ) / σ`, where `z` is the standardized value, `x` is the original data point, `μ` is the mean of the data, and `σ` is the standard deviation of the data. Standardization shifts the data so that the mean becomes 0 and the standard deviation becomes 1. This makes the features easier to compare across different scales. It's especially useful when the data follows a Gaussian distribution (bell curve).

### 06:00 - **Standardization - Intuition**
- Standardization shifts the data so that the mean becomes 0 and the standard deviation becomes 1. This makes the features easier to compare across different scales. It's especially useful when the data follows a Gaussian distribution (bell curve).
  
### 13:55 - **Code Example and Impact of Outliers**
- A code example would typically show how to apply standardization using libraries like `scikit-learn`. One key observation here is that **outliers can significantly affect standardization** because they distort the mean and standard deviation, which impacts how the data is scaled.
  
### 23:20 - **Why scaling is important?**
- Scaling ensures that machine learning algorithms interpret all features equally, preventing larger-range features from dominating those with smaller ranges. It also improves the convergence of gradient-based algorithms by making the optimization landscape smoother.

### 28:22 - **When should you use Standardization?**
- Standardization is generally preferred when the data follows a Gaussian distribution or when algorithms that assume normality, like linear regression or logistic regression, are used.
- It’s also useful when you don’t know the exact range of your data in advance, as it doesn't bound the data to a specific range like normalization.
